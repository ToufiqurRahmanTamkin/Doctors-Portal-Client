# Doctors_Portal_Client_Site
I have developed this project using- React JS, React Routing + private routing, Firebase, React Bootstrap, Fontawesome Icons, React-Hooks, React MODAL.

One user can book an appointment of a doctor. Here is a separate dashboard for admin and user.
An admin can add more admins. and the new admin will get all the access to the admin dashboard.
