# Doctors_Portal_Client_Site
I have developed this project using-
    1. React JS
    2. React Routing + private routing
    3. Firebase
    4. React Bootstrap
    5. Fontawesome Icon

One user can book an appointment of a doctor. Here is a separate dashboard for admin and user.
An admin can add more admins. and the new admin will get all the access to the admin dashboard.
