# Doctors_Portal_Client_Side

Doctors portal is a single page full stack application. One user can get doctor's appointments using this application. For booking a doctor's appointment user must log in to the application. After login users are able to book doctor's appointment.

There is a separate admin and user dashboard. user can see their appointments by selection dates in the dashboard. Here a doctor is an admin. and a doctor can add other doctors. all the doctor list is shown in the homepage.

I have developed this project using- React JS, React Routing + private routing, Firebase, React Bootstrap, Fontawesome Icons, React-Hooks, React-Forms, and React MODAL.

This application is responsive for computer screens and mobile screens.
